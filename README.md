This README will document the following:

* What the application is for:

	* Moodsic is a mood-changing web application which gathers weather, location, and mood data to create playlists which seek to change your mood.

* Running Moodsic in your browser:

	* Navigate to the Moodsic website and click on the "Login to Deezer" link. This will open a separate page which allows you to either create a Deezer ID or log in to an existing account. You will need a Deezer account in order to use Moodsic. Once logged in, simply click on the provided emoticon buttons in order to begin changing your mood. This is an example of a clear day, and an angry playlist:

* Technology contained within the application:

	* We used materialize to design the site, the geoip-db.com API to find your geographic location, the Dark Sky API to figure out the current weather to set the background image, and then the Deezer API to call playlists to coincide with the mood you want to be in. We also use the google analytics API to track the use of our website.  Here are our analytics as of Saturday, July 8, 2017:
