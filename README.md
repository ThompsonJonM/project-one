	* Moodsic is a mood-changing web application which gathers weather, location, and mood data to create playlists which seek to change your mood.

* Running Moodsic in your browser

	* Navigate to the moodsic website and click on the "Login to Deezer" link. This will open a separate page which allows you to either create a Deezer ID or log in to an existing account. Once logged in, simply click on the provided emoticons in order to begin changing your mood.

* Setting up a Deezer Account

	* Navigate to Deezer using the above method. When prompted, create a new registry for a Deezer account (you will be required to enter either a valid email, Google+, or Facebook). Once created, you will have full access to the playlists found within the body of the application.

* Technology contained within the application
